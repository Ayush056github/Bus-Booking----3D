I developed a responsive and interactive web project utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to structure content, style the interface, and add dynamic functionality.

HTML was used to build the semantic structure of the webpage, ensuring accessibility and SEO-friendliness.

CSS was applied to create an attractive and responsive design with layout techniques like Flexbox/Grid, along with custom styles for typography, colors, and animations.

JavaScript enabled interactive elements such as form validations, event handling, dynamic content updates, and DOM manipulation.
